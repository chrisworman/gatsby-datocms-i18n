After cloning this repo, you need to install the dependencies via the developer setup script:

```
$ ./dev-setup.sh
```

Next you'll need a `.env` file in the root directory with the API keys for `datocms`.  Please ask Chris for the file.

Now you're ready to build the project and start the development server:

```
$ yarn develop
```
